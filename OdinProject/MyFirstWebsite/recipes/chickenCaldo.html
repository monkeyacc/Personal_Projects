        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Get about 5 chicken legs and two skinless/boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>Get some carrots</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Add some corn if you'd like</li>
            <li>Get some celery in there as well</li>
            <li>Some GOYA seasoning</li>
            <li>Chopped onion</li>
            <li>Chopped jalepeno (optional)</li>

            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add some other seasonings also ya bloke.</li>
            <li>Similar to our beef caldo recipe, we  want to first let the chicken cook first.</li>
            <li>Now, we want to wash and prep all of veggies. Let's cut them into some reasonably size portions/bite size. Throw them into the pot.</li>
            <li>Cook the veggies to desired tenderness.</li>
            <li>Once your kitchen is smelling amazing and you can tell that the caldo is done, serve it up!</li>
            <li>Add some chopped onion, chopped jalepeno, and crushed pepper for some texture and spice!</li>
            <li>Squeeze a bit of lime in there if you're into that sort of thing and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
