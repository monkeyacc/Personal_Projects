        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>So this is one of my favorite snacks: a chocolate protein shake. </p>
        <p></p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 scoop (25g) of your favorite chocolate powder protein</li>
            <li>6 - 8 ice cubes depending on their size (if big 6, if medium sized 8)</li>
            <li>1 medium sized banana</li>
            <li>6 fluid ounces of water</li>
            <li>I occasionally add some fruit to switch it up, usually strawberries or blueberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Let's take tour blender and first add your scoop of protein powder followed by the ice cubes</li>
            <li>Breaking up the banana by hand into pieces, let's also add that to our blender</li>
            <li>With this third step, we add out water and any other berries that'd you like (try not to overdue it)</li>
            <li>Blend the ingredients until it has reached a smooth texture and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
