        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>What we have here is a simple but powerful meal. It's very well balanced, flavor-wise. Please ignore the egg & spinach, it was leftovers.</p>
        <p></p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium sized skinless/boneless chicken breast</li>
            <li>1 medium sized sweet potato</li>
            <li>Chicken seasoning</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Homemade salsa</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slap that chicken down onto a cutting board, slice it hamburger way and season it with some "chicken" seasoning</li>
            <li>Next, we're going to drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive oil onto a hot pan and cook the chicken breast.</li>
            <li>Next, we will wash and cut the sweet potato into slices, placing them onto a microwave-safe plate and heat them up for 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now that our chicken breast is cooked, we can slice them into slices.</li>
            <li>Once the sweet potato is soft and lightly seasoned, we can enjoy with our chicken breast and some homemade salsa.</li>
            <li>For the most important step, enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
