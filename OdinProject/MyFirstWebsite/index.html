            <p>Today has been a really good day for me so far. I got the gym by 8am this morning and had a pretty good leg lift with my friend/barber Javi.
            I also hit some pretty good exercise statistics. I crushed my current back-squat weights and hit a new PR of 185 lbs. for 1 rep.
            The following will be the order in which I did my exercises today and their included stats: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Warm Up and Stretching</li>
                <li>Barbell Back-Squats</li>
                <li>Seated Leg Press</li>
                <li>Laying Leg Curls</li>
                <li>Seated Leg Extensions</li>
                <li>Standing Calf Raises</li>
                <li>Inclined Treadmill Walk</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I attended my resume review appointment today. The reviewer had some great suggestions and I did go ahead and applied some of them.</p>

            <p>I've also been slowly prying at Kevin to go to The Weeknd concert coming up on 7/24/22 -- he'll be performing at Soldier Field (yeet).
            I'm more than sure that'll be a great time with Nancy regardless. She bought my tickets to the concert. I love her so much -- she's dope.</p>
                
            
            <p>It's 10:19pm right now, writing this and listening to the Modern Day Hippies Podcast (which you should also really check out). I'm listneing 
            the second part with Dr.K. They're all doing so well and am so proud of the three girls. They've done so much and all of their consistent 
            hard work does not go unnoticed. </p>
